<div class="container pt-5 mt-5 bg-dark">
  <p>My origin :</p>
  <p>I come from a family of 2 kids, my sister and me. My parents split up when I was around 8 years old, since them I have got 3 more sisters. When my parents split up, my mom found a better job in the United Kingdom,
    so me, her and my sister moved to the United Kingdom when I was age 8,5 or so. In the UK, I went to 3 different schools over the 3 years I have lived there. First one was <b>Goldbeaters Primary School</b>. I spent most of my time there and I probably enjoyed my 
    time the most there. After leaving the Primary School due to going to Secondary, I moved to <b>Friern Barnet School</b>, I spent only 2 months there, but it was okay-ish. We had to move, because of personal problems, leading me to go to the last school which I spent the rest of my time there 
    and it was probably the worst but the best looking, worst because of the kids and I didn't really fit in properly. The school is called <b>Teddington School</b>. After that, we moved back to the Czech Republic and I have been living here since.
